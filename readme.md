# Profile Scroller

## Project Overview

The **Profile Scroller** is a mini-project designed to practice the use of JavaScript generator functions. It allows users to click the "Next" button to scroll through different user profiles. This project demonstrates how a generator can iterate over a list of profiles, providing a dynamic and seamless user experience.

## Purpose and Motivation

The primary goal of this project is to showcase the practical implementation of JavaScript iterator generators. By building the Profile Scroller, it helps in understanding how generators work and how they can be used to cycle through data efficiently.

## Features

- **Dynamic Profile Display**: Updates the displayed profile information each time the "Next" button is clicked.
- **Continuous Scrolling**: Uses a generator function to cycle through profiles indefinitely as of now it has limited number of profiles.

## Use Case

This project can be adapted for various purposes, such as dating apps, employee directories, social media platforms, or portfolio sites to display user profiles dynamically.

Enjoy using the Profile Scroller!
